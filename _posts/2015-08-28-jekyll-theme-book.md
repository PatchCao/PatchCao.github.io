Simple is better, but many themes are over designed.

Get started
-----------

1.  fork the repository.
2.  clone `git clone https://github.com/username/book`
3.  run `jekyll serve -w`

[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) should be ready.

Customize
---------

### _config.yml file

* title: site name
* description: site description
* url: site url
* avatar: absolute path of avatar which is a picture (140px * 140px) on the index page.
* favicon: absolute path of site favicon
* about: content on the about page.
  you can write more than one paragraph but the format should be like the original one.
  the special word `?link?` will be replaced by one of the links which are listed under links.

### warning

Please do not delete the first two lines of style.css file.

End.
